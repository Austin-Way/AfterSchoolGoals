Category 1 - Dopamine in Games
Summary/Core Idea: Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps your brain understand/interpret goals/rewards.
Reward Prediction Error: (RPE)
RPE is the difference between what you expect and what you get. The brain uses this "error" to update what to chase next. X = reward + next value - expected value. 
Dopamine Neurons fire more when outcomes are better than expected & fire less or pause when worse. They are neutral when the reward is as expected. Surprise will always beat certainty. 
Uncertainty / Variable Rewards. 
Games work best when the outcome sits in a "maybe" zone. Dopamine is most prominently released during times of uncertainty and peaks when the chance of reward is approximately 50%. That sustained "could happen" keeps your attention locked on it. 
Variable-ratio schedules (which are rewards that arrive after a random number of actions) produce the largest, fasted form of dopamine. Players will keep using the system because of the uncertainty.  
I was able to show this when I build Grow-A-Beanstalk for our hackathon. The action the player took was fully random, which meant they got significantly more dopamine release and had a higher pull back to the game.
"Almost wins" work very similarly. 
Reward density (which is a subset of VRS) is the average rate at which a player receives a reward / behavior reinforcement over time. (This depends on the type of reward / genre)

Summary:
1. Your brain can distinguish between different types of dopamine. Meaning if you receive a reward your brain would know it was dopamine caused by the reward. If you receive dopamine for social interaction your brain would know. 
2. What is more crazy than the above is that dopamine goes to different places. Dopamine earned from a reward can travel different neural pathways than dopamine earned through social interaction. 
3. That is insane. You can build a tolerance to reward-based dopamine and social dopamine separately. This again is insane. That means that if you only offer reward-based dopamine in the beginning, then switch to social dopamine you could completely remove the tolerance to the reward-based dopamine and then just swap it back. This is the solution to games` getting boring. 
To explain a bit more: We have 2 types of dopamine, first (food/survival related) and secondary (social interaction) to that end, they can be distinguished. 
(In theory)

Summary:
Social dopamine can be released from positive social interactions such as your friend praising you. It can also be released in anticipation of good social interaction, and from positive person interactions such as garnering likes on youtube.

Study:
Summary: 
Types of social interaction that releases social dopamine:
Social Praise / Recognition
Social Anticipation - Group looking forward to update/activity.
Social interaction in general. - i.e. talking with someone else in a call.
Altruistic behavior in a group.
Group Achievements.
Sence of belonging.
Teaching someone else.
Group Synchronization.
Social Achievement - Gaining respect, Winning challenges, etc.

Summary:
I am including this to clarify something. Social dopamine (Dopamine released from social interaction) does not cause harm. An increase in social dopamine can ONLY result in harm if associated with an already harmful activity. (For example, skipping homework to do something else is already destructive.) Yes! Skipping homework is considered bad, but you have to understand that the social dopamine itself is not harmful.

Summary:
The article talks about how the team reduced the dopamine receptors of a group of rats & increased the dopamine receptors of another group of rats. They studied the rats to see if the time they spent interacting socially increased. They found that rats with the ability to receive more dopamine were more likely to interact.

Gender Ratio: 
Summary:
Gender does play a role in how you act. For example: Men typically are more aggressive and assertive. In-fact they bond better socially through more engaging/Dramatic experiences. Women on the other had are are the opposite, they are much more supportive as a team and bond more over more soothing experiences
Okay, onto why that matters. 
It is better to sort all men for more dramatic experiences. If there is a demographic of women playing them game you want to spread them out as much as possible. 
It is better to sort all women for more soothing experinces. If there is a demographic of men playing the game you want to spread hem out as much as possible. 
If the game is a mix of both you want to mix the groups.
This combination is the most efficient for grouping based on gender.

Rat Park! 
Summary:
Rat Park, is one of the, if not the most influential study I will ever cover in this brainlift.  Rat Park was an experiment designed to test if isolation equals addiction. The research team split rats into 2 groups, in one group they put all of the rats in isolation and gave them the option between heroin water and normal water.  One by one the rats in isolation all drank themselves to death. The other group was put in a "park" where they could socialize and almost all of them did not drink the heroin water. The study also put heroin-addicted rats into the rat park and found that they became unaddicted. To synthesize this information and connect why it matters: This study found that isolation causes the addiction that makes the rats kill themselves. If you are social the opposite happens. Isolation is common in the world today... And social games might just fix that.

Importance of continuous engagement off-platform.   
Summary: 
Direct quote from the article: "Analysis revealed that 78% of lasting gaming friendships (defined as those persisting over 1 year) involved regular communication through channels outside of the game environment, such as Discord, WhatsApp, or in-person meetings."

Pitch tracking:
Summary: 
This section covers how to track pitch. Pitch is supper important to track since you can detect so much with it. For example, you can track laughter, toxicity, rudeness, and engagement in conversation. 
Rudeness/Anger/Discontent is characterized by low pitch ( below average) 
Happyness is charecterized by high pitch (above average ) 
Toxicness is charecterized by jagad spikes.
Laughter is characterized by smooth spikes.
By tacking the above it provides the system feedback on weather or not the user enjoyed playing with those people.
Pitch will be super important (Like I stated above) since it can be tracked with little to no cost. Instead of processing what they say, you can just track their pitch and it is arguably just as good as knowing what they are saying.  
Interestingly, the most emotion happens between 2.5-4kHz and 0-250Hz.
Your voice has a natural vibration of 130 times per second but when your angry this increases to about 336 times per second. Meaning you can predict anger.
To accurately capture voice patterns you need to take at least 8000 measurments per second though the more the better.
It varies by region -- Since there are different cultures.
Interest Sorting. 
Summery:
I have slightly shide away from this in my research, but wanted to bring up my stance on the matter. Interest is important, but not while playing a game. It has a slight effect on your ability to bond but playing a game together also allows that bond to form. 
To clarify: I am pro interest matters, however I am closer to the midde. It matters, but the context to witch it matters is also very important. In a game, the experience will be enough to bond, this only slightly boosts it.

Frequency of gaming / Predictability of gaming session. 
 
I am not even sure where else I put this in my document (I think I put it somewhere, but could not find it so it is going here. Here is my algorithm plan: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cfS3ZUAsevNDR2VaAiU1k-CqPh9yhwifyHKQzUOBV-U/edit?usp=sharing
My Research Questions:
Summary:
This section roughly covers all research that does not exist, but is necessary for my algorithm to function. The goal would be to come up with an answer for each research question. 
1. What is the optimal duration for an online interaction to maximize dopamine release before engagement declines?

2. What is the optimal reward  2 social interaction ratio. 
3. 
Graphing Best Possible Dopamine Scenario WITH reward-based game mechanics. 
In video game matching, social-based matches activate the ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex. This region is part of the reward circuitry. Interestingly, though, excessive mismatches (Bad social interaction) trigger amygdala hyperactivity associated with social threat detection. (Simplified: If the reaction is bad, the player gets stressed. (Witch releases cortizal, witch impairs prefrontal cortex function reducing decision making quality & cooperation abilities)  
Gaming addiction follows a U-shaped pattern. (In terms of enjoyment. You hit the tipping point of the U around 26 hours if your moderately addicted to the game and 37 if your highly addicted to a game. 
When you play a game with social interaction you brain experiences a stead increase in dopamine release as you bond with teammates. This dopamine rise peaks at arouund 45-60 of continuous social interaction. After the peak your brain reduces rescptor sensitivity to maintain homeostasis, the prefrontal cortex responsible for social processing experiences decreased glucose utilization, your networks handling social cues become less responsive (Similar to muscle fatigue).
More or less after 45-60 minutes your social interaction ability decreasees. 
You can fix this though. If you force players to stop playing for 5 -10 minutes after this timeframe you can more or less reset the curve.You can also alternate between high-coordination activities and lower-intensity activities. 
You can monitor performance metrics (How well they are playing) to determine if they are fatigued. 
(BTW this is why youtube asks you to take a break)
Action/Shooter-games actually require a 15 minutes "cooldown" for every 75 minutes played. 
You build a tolerance to social based dopamine around 6-8 weeks vs reward based dopamine witch is around 2-3 weeks. 
(3% daily increase in social intensity) yields 29% higher 30-day retention and 41% lower social anxiety markers.
You can restore 78% of your tonic baseline (meaning 22% from normal) if you don't play the specific game for 96 hours.
 
Men are more susceptible to addiction in gaming because they exhibit different dopamine responses. Men have higher reward center activation, which causes more susceptibility. Women have better executive control and different reward processing patterns. (Witch is better resistance) to addiction.
Men experience rapid, intense dopamine spikes. (Can happen from gaming) Women have more sustained less intensive responses. If women get addicted, even though they are less susceptible, they might have way worse effects like function impairment. 
The Substantia nigra is involved in moter control and reward processing. It contains dopamine producing neurons. Men have more dopamine neurons in the substratia nigra witch means their reward processing is more concentrated in areas that influence motivation/ (Making them more responsive to intense immedia rewards) Like those found in gaming.
The Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA is responsible for releasing dopamine to areas like the prefrontal cortex, striatum, and amygdala. Since women have more dopamine neurons in the VTA it influences it can promote controlled responses to intense dopamine release.
Effects on children:
1. Increased vulnerability to reward based behaviors.
2 .Habit formation is easier.
3. For women, since they have increased activity there, they are more susceptible in early life do the bad effects of video games. (So, hypothetically, if you are exposed to crates/lootboxes as a women you are more susceptible to get addicted to slot machines later in life than a man exposed to the same thing.)
After excessive gaming your brain filters unnecessary stimuli. (Like chat messages, GUI features or shop ads) -- Meaning, the less you show the better and the better you show it the more beneficial.
Different types of games can have different effects on your cognitive function. High action, intense, games can cause aggression.  
Interestingly I was looking for stats on how much social interaction is documented to increase social interaction. (Since I need to outreach to developers) I found that it increases it from a factor of 0.13-0.72 or 0.2-0.5 No one is really 100% since it varies by game. Still, a great increase. 
Morning VS Night gaming can effect match quality. It is better for them to be more consistent (not MORE quality, very similar) This is because it will keep them more engaged in the game without decreasing social dopamine receptors ability to process and respond
To give context to the topic I am about to cover I need to note some things.
Mainly, you can predict dopamine release because it correlates to a players social interaction, how many times the retry challenges, how often they return to the game and how long they play.
Now, I am discussing the reliability of such gameplay behaviors.
For context, there are primary rewards (achievements loot drops etc) and secondary rewards( social praise or recognition)
Though, no behavior provides a direct measurement of dopamine at best. They correlate with common patterns observed when the reward system is active.
Correlation is not causation.
Example: If the gameplay session is long it might mean dopamine release but could also simply mean the player had free time or felt obligated to finish a quest.
Individual differences are also important to consider. One player's brain might release dopamine more readily for social rewards while another might be driven by achievement.
Dopamine neuron firing tends to ramp up when a reward cue is present (so even if they don't get one the idea that they might keeps them playing)
Concept of behavioral economics. People prefer uncertainty, overvalue rare wins, and discount future rewards.
Achievements are needed when you start playing a game, but it MUST switch to social goals...
Cooperative social interactions lead to more sustained dopamine release. It is typically better than Competitive in terms of how long it will engage a user. Competitive gaming is more of an intense spike (Though it can be gradual, given the anticipated feeling of being "better") 
Sleep is important for dopamine receptor sensitivity. If a player has good sleep patterns, they are more receptive to rewarding stimuli. (Meaning that incentivizing players to stay up late is counterintuitive) If you have poor sleep, it may make you more irritated or frustrated when playing a game or interacting in a group. High amounts of sleep generally make players more emotionally stable Vs poor sleep, which makes them more stressed.
Oxytocin is the chemical component that bonds with dopamine during bonding / altruistic behavior. This means that the only way of replicating social-based dopamine is to increase altruistic behavior or bonding. Leaderboards and other related features will not have the same effect. 
Altruistic behavior is the single biggest cause of social based dopamine release. Altruistic behavior typically happens in social setting with friends etc.  
Altruistic behavior correlates with the quality of the social bond. (e.g., the better friends you have, the more altruistic you are. ) This means that using my algorithm increases altruism, and that is another factor for higher retention. I will note, though, that altruistic behavior does not increase short-term retention and is a long-term form of engagement.
Beacuse of this correlation your community will improve overall from using my algorithm. Because it increases the effectiveness of bonding it also create an imbalance to dopamine and oxytocin. This makes people naturally adapt to become more altruistic.
Category 2 - Oxytocin
Summary/Core Idea: Oxytocin is a neuropeptide. It determines how much you care about social outcomes. (Such as: Approval, Belonging & Trust)  It also determines how much attention, memory, and emotion your brain invests in thoes social cues. It doesn't necessarily cause behavior directly. Instead, it acts as a signaling agent. 
Unlike dopamine, oxytocin can't be directly measured in the human brain. (At least with current tech) That means most human studies rely on indirect evidence. (It is important to note, though, that most studies infer oxytocin's role by combining prior findings, such as in animals that we can track.) 
We know this, though: Oxytocin is synthesized in the hypothalamus and released in both the bloodstream and directly into the brain. In the brain, it targets areas involved in emotion, reward, and socially related memory. (Especially the amygdala, ventral striatum, and prefrontal cortex.) It does vary between the different genders. 
(In layman's terms:)
It helps/facilitates the learning of social rewards/punishments. 
 It increases attention to social cues. 
It amplifies social motivations (e.g., Bonding, cooperation, or negatively defense / exclusion.) 
Oxytocin and dopamine systems are interlocked in how the brain learns from social outcomes. "Social reinforcement" (like being trusted, included, praised, etc), which activates reward areas in your brain like the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area (VTA). That activation depends at least in part on oxytocin. Oxytocin helps flag social moments as valuable, and dopamine handles the learning from those social interactions. 
Oxytocin and dopamine co-activate in social contexts. 
 
Oxytocin helps flag social "moments" as valuable and dopamine handles the learning from thoes social interactions. Oxytocin can, however, act as a sole motivator if dopamine receptors are incredibly weak; however, that is almost impossible, and if dopamine receptors were that downregulated, the person would be considered clinically depressed.
(This section covers the Biological basis of oxytocin.)
The Hypothalaums
I strongly believe that the context of why I am talking about this topic is necessary here.  When people talk about oxytocin, they usually jump right to calling it the "love hormone."  Of Course, that is catchy, but to understand how it actually works, you first have to understand where in the brain it's made and how it travels throughout the brain/body. The main place oxytocin is produced is a region that is quite small; however, it still produces a lot of oxytocin: the hypothalamus.
(I am using an analogy here because I also believe that having one to explain this concept is very useful) Think of the hypothalamus like the control tower of the airport that manages flights coming in and out. Within said control tower, there are two special "offices" where oxytocin is made. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN for short) and the supraoptic nucleus (SON for short). Both of these pump out oxytocin, but they also have different routes they pump it out. 
Some oxytocin goes into the bloodstream, spreading through the body. This happens for big events like childbirth or stress responses. (And stress response is the most relevant to gaming) (I likely will go into more detail about that later on) 
Expanding on the above: Oxytocin flows across the body and can affect many different regions of your body. Some good examples are that it lowers stress hormones after you hug someone, and also adjusts your heart rate. More or less, the "whole-body" oxytocin release tells your brain: "Hey, something socially meaningful is happening, you should calm down and connect with this other person."
Other oxytocin goes directly to the brain area. It moves along nerve fibers into regions tied to emotions, motivation, and reward. 
Some oxytocin neurons released into the brain area send signals directly into specific brain areas. (Like reward circuitry)
A good example of this is when you're playing a game with friends and everyone wins together. Oxytocin can be released directly into your ventral tegmental area (VTA). Which is the dominant "factory" of the brain, and that will give your brain an increased reward. Oxytocin in this context is like a booster that amplifies dopamine. 
Direct brain signaling is what makes oxytocin so important for long term motivation. 
This matters a lot because the oxytocin that affects motivation in gaming isn't the one going into the rest of your body; it's the oxytocin going into your reward system and emotional brain centers. (Which, like I spoke about above, is how we determine if the social interaction is worth it or not) 
Another huge takeaway from the above that is important is that oxytocin isn't just "one thing"; it can act as a hormone or a neurochemical signal. Oxytocin is NOT just a social bonding chemical, and that is an oversimplification. (I say that specifically because the first sentence of this bullet created the inference that oxytocin is just a broad framing for anything that involves social interaction, but again, that is not true.) 
Where oxytocin goes in the brain. 
Oxytocin doesn't necessarily affect the entire brain equally. It has specific "docking stations" (receptors) in certain areas. (This is a really great comparison: Enzymes have an "active site" and when a second molecule binds to that allosteric site, it changes the enzyme's shape, making the active site work better). Oxytocin is a bit simpler than that. Oxytocin binds to oxytocin receptors (OXTRs), BUT these receptors can be modulated by other molecules. (Dopamine, estrogen, etc.) (Also certain drugs) 
Here are the main destinations of oxytocin:
1. Amygdala which is the brains threat detector. This is typically on high alert for danger, betrayal, etc, but oxytocin can "turn down" this reception."
In games without this effect, you would be paranoid in multiplayer constantly. Oxytocin increases your willingness to cooperate. 
2. Ventral Striatum / Nucleus Accumbens. (The reward hub) This is where dopamine is normally triggered for things like money, food, or, in the gaming context, loot drops. When oxytocin "docks" here, it basically says: "Hey, make social success feel just as rewarding as the loot box."
This is also typically why you feel more rewarded whenever you are with friends in a game. 
3. Prefrontal Cortex. This has to do with your brain weighing risks / controling impulses, making long-term choices. Oxytocin here increases your tendency to value relationships over short-term rewards. 
4. Hippocampus (this is your memory hub) This region stores your experinces and Oxytocin strenghtens socail memories. (Super simplified way of explaining this, but its not super relevant)
In gaming this also makes you remember a specific game more even after you haven't played it in a long time.
Put together, these are the main places oxytocin goes in the brain and give context to why oxytocin isn't just raw excitement. (which is dopamine's job)
One of the most important things to understand is that oxytocin and dopamine work together to motivate you.
Dopamine gives you the buzz of novelty and the thrill of winning. It is what makes you want to play again.
Oxytocin gives you the connection and the loyalty to come back. "I want to stay with these people for motivation."
Oxytocin and dopamine often activate together and in the same places. 
Because we are currently unable to study the chemical directly in the brain, we have to rely on animal studies as a source of information. From the animal studies, we can discern that if you block oxytocin in the brain's reward hub (the nucleus accumbens, talked about above), the animal doesn't form pair bonds (connections with others) even though dopamine is still working/activated. If you block dopamine instead, the same things happen. Which means that both chemicals are required for a human (animal) to bond.
We only have empirical based tests where we don't truly test the chemical reaction in the brain and instead look at the physical response.
There was a study conducted that showed people given oxytocin keep investing in others even haver they have been betrayed. The main reason for this is that oxytocin boosted the value of the relationship over that of short-term outcomes.
This is why multiplayer is addictive in different ways than single-player reward-centric games. 
Why you can't measure oxytocin easily. 
It is possible to measure oxytocin, and scientists often do measure it in blood or saliva, then make claims about what is happening in the brain. The truth is that we can't measure it in the brain itself. 
Blood oxytocin and brain oxytocin aren't always in sync. You can feel bonded and socially engaged without a big spike in oxytocin blood levels. 
The brain release is what matters for motivation/trust, and we can't measure that directly in humans right now. 
The above is why so many oxytocin studies seem contradictory. A lot depends on the context, timing, and which brain areas are involved in oxytocin release. 
In the game development context, you can't think of oxytocin like dopamine. It is not simply possible to crank a lever and get a predictable hit of the chemical.
