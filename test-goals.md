# Test Goals for Enhanced AI Question System

## Goals that should trigger clarifying questions:

1. **"Complete 150 XP on CodeSignal"**
   - AI should ask: "What is CodeSignal? What type of challenges or activities does it offer?"
   - User can explain: "CodeSignal is a coding assessment platform where you solve programming challenges to earn XP points."

2. **"Write 5 articles for Hashnode"**
   - AI should ask: "What is Hashnode? What type of articles would you be writing?"
   - User can explain: "Hashnode is a developer blogging platform where I write technical articles about programming."

3. **"Get 200 points in Brilliant"**
   - AI should ask: "What is Brilliant? How are points earned on this platform?"
   - User can explain: "Brilliant is an interactive learning platform for math and science where you earn points by completing lessons and solving problems."

4. **"Complete 3 Brainlift research papers"**
   - AI already knows Brainlift but might ask: "What specific topics will you research? How long should each paper be?"

5. **"Finish my capstone project"**
   - AI should ask: "What type of capstone project? What does 'finished' mean specifically? What are the deliverables?"

6. **"Do 50 challenges on HackerEarth"**
   - AI should ask: "What is HackerEarth? What type of challenges does it offer?"

## Goals that should validate directly:

1. **"Complete 150 XP in Python programming challenges on LeetCode"** (with screenshot)
2. **"Write 3 Brainlift research articles on AI ethics, each 1500+ words"**
3. **"Send 12 personalized cold emails to potential clients with follow-up tracking"**

## Expected AI Behavior:
- Be curious about unfamiliar platforms, tools, or concepts
- Ask specific questions rather than making assumptions
- Use user explanations to make accurate assessments
- Provide detailed feedback incorporating the new knowledge
